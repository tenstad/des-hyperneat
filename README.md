# Deep Evolvable-Substrate HyperNEAT - Extending ES-HyperNEAT with Multiple Substrates in an Evolving Topology

Rust implementation of the DES-HyperNEAT framework, along with three concrete
implementations:

- Layered DES-HyperNEAT (LaDES)
- Single CPPN DES-HyperNEAT (SiDES)
- Coevolutional DES-HyperNEAT (CoDES)
